# ML

This repository is to record my implementation of both common widely adopted deep learning nerual network structures and algorithms and those just appeared in research papers. I will also post my findings as to how my results compare to baselines, as well as posting interesting comparison studies on the the performance differences between different structures, activation functions and optimization methods, etc.
